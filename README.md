Auto Clicker (AutoHotkey v2)

A simple Auto Clicker built with AutoHotkey v2, featuring a GUI for customizable click intervals and hotkey rebinding. This project helped me explore GUI development, user input handling, and macros in AHK. 

Note: The key remapping does not delete your previous binded key so do beware.

⏱️ Adjustable click intervals (hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds).

🎛️ Start/Stop toggle button with live updates.

🎹 Custom hotkey rebinding (set your own key to toggle clicking).
